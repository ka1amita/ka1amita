# About me

> Work smart, not hard.

## Introduction
Through some statistical tools for scientists I realised how old-school chemists are and how much would the field benefit from application of maths, modern technologies and approches so common in IT. Through that I have become interested in data science and in coding in general. Currently I still have a job as a chemist, but I can't imagine staying in the filed and I am studying hard to get a job in IT by 2024. I dream that once in the future I will be able to combine both passions together and work on the intersection of IT and Chemistry.

## Basic facts <!-- TO DO: add more details about me later -->
* I come from Czech Republic 
* I was born in 1989
* I have got Master's in Chemictry at UCT Pague
* I have passion for development
* I love drinking coffee, doing orienteering or just spending time in the Nature

## My goal
I am looking for a project on the intersection of Chemistry and IT. Let me know if you are up to something.
